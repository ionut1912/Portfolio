  "My journey in software development began as a self-taught developer, driven by a deep curiosity for what powers the video games I loved. That passion evolved into a structured foundation during university, where I sharpened my skills through personal projects and hackathons — consistently delivering solutions under pressure and tight deadlines.",
  "Over the past five years, I have architected and delivered end-to-end solutions across the full stack — from optimizing complex database pipelines and building robust desktop applications to leading the design and development of scalable web platforms. I bring ownership, technical depth, and a consistent track record of shipping production-grade software on time.",
